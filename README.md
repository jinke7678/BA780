# Summary:
In recent years, there has been a concerning upward trend in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), especially among young generations in the U.S. In pursuit of better health for the youth, this project is designed to delve into a selected CVD dataset, employing various analytical methods to extract valuable insights. We will be utilizing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2021.

The primary objective of this project is to enhance awareness of CVDs and to encourage healthier lifestyle choices, particularly among individuals under the age of 35. Recently, the rise in CVD cases has made it a pivotal subject of research in the medical field. Our dataset, sourced from Kaggle, will be thoroughly explored through modeling and analysis, utilizing various methodologies.

By conducting this analysis, we aspire to make a significant contribution to CVD awareness and encourage healthier living practices among the younger generation, including our classmates who are under the age of 35.
